# Blah Website
Done a lot with HTML and CSS, so I'm looking into SVG animations using only CSS and no JS. This is something I haven't really done before but I'm super curious about it.

## To Do
- [ ] Landing page, recreate [this page](https://sva-starter.glitch.me/) using only CSS. 
- [ ] Add an obligatory button, do something stupid with js for it.
