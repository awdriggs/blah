Done a lot with HTML and CSS, so I'm looking into SVG animations using only CSS and no JS. This is something I haven't really done before but I'm super curious about it.

## To Do
- [X] Landing page, recreate [this page](https://sva-starter.glitch.me/) using only CSS. 
- [X] Add an obligatory form, do something stupid with js for it.
- [ ] Try adding random with CSS only.
